Hideyoshi
Age: 27 years
Job: Archer
Main weapon: bow
Hideyoshi is an archer, who works under the same lord as Masamune. He has a carefree nature and often tries to cheer his comrades up by making jokes – usually bad ones. At first glance, he may appear irresponsible, but his loyalty towards his lord is just as great as Masamune’s. On the battlefield his strong suite is ranged combat using his bow. Hideyoshi can also serve as a medic as he acquired these skills in order to be of even more use for his comrades. His laid-back attitude often hides how much he cares for others, even for the enemies he kills, though he doesn’t hesitate to shoot and tries to cover his feelings up by making bad jokes – again.
Hideyoshi has neither a wife nor children since he “can’t settle for a single woman”.
