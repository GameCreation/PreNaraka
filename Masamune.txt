Masamune
Age: 29 years
Job: Samurai
Main weapon: Katana
Masamune is a Samurai in his late twenties and very skilled in the art of Kendo (Japanese swordsmanship). Obeying his lord unconditionally and following the road of the warrior straightly, he is looked up to by many as the perfect example of a Samurai. He kills his enemies without hesitation or expressing pity. Therefore he is also well known for being merciless and cruel. This image is only reinforced by his serious and somewhat cold attitude, leading most people to assume that he never thinks of anything but his duty.
However, Masamune cherishes his wife, who is two years younger than he himself, and his five years old son deeply. He doesn’t have much time for them, but whenever he’s at home, he shows his soft side and smiles a lot, though he never ever laughs since his life as a Samurai, all the people he killed so far and – most importantly – all of his fallen comrades have toughened him up.
Masamune fights not only with his duty on mind, but also in order to protect his young family and the men standing beside him. Sometimes he may get rather reckless.
