Rokudo
Age: 34 years
Job: farmer / soldier
Main weapon: lance
Rokudo is a former farmer who now fights alongside Masamune.
During the war his village was attacked by enemy armies. In the process many houses were burned down and a lot of people died in the flames, among them were Rokudo’s wife and his three children. Rokudo himself, who was working outside on the fields when the attack started, fought bravely to safe anything that was left to safe. However, the situation seemed hopeless until Masamune’s troop arrived and managed to defeat the enemy. The village was completely destroyed and only few people survived. Masamune decided to recruit Rokudo, since he witnessed his talent in battle. Having no home left, Rokudo went along with it, despite not liking the idea of fighting for someone who simply sends out men to die on the battlefield while sitting inside his castle safely. He also can’t understand Masamune’s loyalty for this person, but usually keeps his thoughts and doubts toward the higher ups to himself in order to increase his own life span which is already short enough in the times of war.
Rokudo uses a lance in battle, so he’s strong in middle-ranged fights. He can’t read.
